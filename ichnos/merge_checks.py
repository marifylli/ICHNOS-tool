"""Merge diagnostics: unit checks, collision checks and shared-parameter
reporting, run while the submodels are combined.

Migrated from Ichnos_PULSE python/ichnos_diagnostics.py @ e66de65c. Function
bodies are unchanged.

One function was not carried over: check_for_stale_duplicate(), which
compared the packaged TIP-TetR SBML against a second copy under the research
repository's matlab/ directory. That path does not exist in this repository
and the duplicate it guarded against is a property of the research repo's
layout, not of the product.
