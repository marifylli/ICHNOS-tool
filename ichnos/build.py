"""The merge core: reads the separate SBML submodels and combines them in
memory, matching by NAME rather than by id (the submodels were exported by
different COPASI/SimBiology sessions, so ids are GUIDs that do not line up).
This is the part that actually produces the merged model.

Migrated from Ichnos_PULSE python/ichnos_core.py @ e66de65c. All merge logic,
unit aliasing and parameter values are unchanged. What changed:

  - source SBML comes from packaged resources via ichnos.config, not from a
    sibling checkout's integration/ directory;
  - the stale-duplicate check against the research repo's matlab/ copy is
    gone, along with that path;
  - build_variant_sbml_string() no longer writes to disk by default. Saving
    is an explicit call with an explicit output directory, so that building a
    model has no side effects on the filesystem;
  - the variant argument is validated, and an unsupported variant (copper)
    raises rather than falling through to a KeyError.
